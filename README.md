# SolarCar-BatteryPackControl

Controls the discharge, charge, and emergency disconnect for the battery pack of the Principia RaXI solar car. Takes inputs from the driver control panel and communicates over CAN to the battery pack control board.

This project is a copy from the private Principia Solar Car repository and excludes library and include files for privacy. I contributed alongside two other developers in coding, debugging, and testing this project.

The project uses the PIO and Arduino libraries to control a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
